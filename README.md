# Javascript-testing

## About This Project
This project is based on the concept of test-driven javascript programming. Here, I have used the starter code given by Udacity and the 
jasmine testing framework to create a series of test suites for the efficiency of my application.

## Getting Started
* To load the feed reader app with the jasmine specsheet simply clone this repository or create a pull request.Get more information about pull requests [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
* If you aren't comfortable with either of these, another option would be to simply download the zip file.

## Requirement
The specsheet has been tested only on Chrome, so it is recommended that you use it for further testing and review.

## Diving in Deep
If you want to write further tests you may do so, in the feedreader.js file in the spec subfolder of the jasmine folder.I have written some basic tests which address the basic functionality of the application, so if you want to test more, you'll have to add more features.
To write more tests you can refer to the jasmine framework documentation [here](https://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction)

## Sources
1. [Udacity](www.udacity.com) for the feed reader application code.
2. [Jasmine 2.2](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) testing framework.

### Note 
There is one error that keeps showing up on the developer console. It says that the module feeds cannot be found. If anybody has an explanation please feel free to implement a bug fix or simply let me know how to fix it !!
